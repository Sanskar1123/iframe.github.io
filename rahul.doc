Happy birthday Aakriti.
                First of all is like to let you know that YOU ARE A GEM 💎 (but mujhe aisa nhi lagta)😂 We met for the first time on
                your birthday itself and it has been a crazy year. Gradually we became so good friends that now I can't even think of
                SNU without you. We used to chat and laugh during CSD labs. Our bond strengthened because of SDC(aaj taana nhi
                maarunga😂). I miss all those SDC meetings in which we used to discuss crazy ideas, watch movies, play teen patti (and
                thoda sa kaam bhi). I remember those late talks with you after which I had to sleep with my lights on 🙂. We pitched
                crazy startup ideas just for getting a chocolate 🍫😂 and I really miss working on dustbin which won 2 entrepreneurship
                competitions. It'd have never been possible without a teammate like you.♥️ Your bhaiya, dad and commerce wali friend
                were always to the rescue whenever we needed some advice on anything. 😂
                I'm still surprised tujhe kuch nhi hua even after drinking plastic. Haan itne asaani se peecha thodi chodegi ab tu.
                Jokes apart, have an amazingg birthday ❤️💯.
                Happy 19!🥳
